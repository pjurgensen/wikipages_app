#Getting familiar with Ember
##Epicodus project: Rebuilding Wikipages using Ember
###Patti Jurgensen

* To start off, follow along with the previous lesson, rebuilding Wikipages using Ember.

* Then, follow along with the Ember.js Getting Started guide to build (you guessed it) a To Do app. In the guide, they build a standalone app without Rails, which is a good exercise. When you're done, build a Rails API app, and then switch from using the Fixture Adapter to using the Active Model REST adapter, so that the app can save its data to your Rails API backend.

* Finally, we haven't really talked about testing. The simplest thing to do is to continue testing your app with Capybara and Poltergeist, and that's the approach we'll take for now.
